### LAB 1
[Condition](https://github.com/PlugaruT/WebTechnologiesLabs/tree/master/lab-1)

# Solution:
In this Laboratory work I created a website that will serve to sell electronic products like tablets,smartphones, etc., using bootstrap framework.
On home page wich is index.html, I have a navigation bar with 4 elements(Home, Tablets, Smartphones, Contact). 
For entire websites I used Grid System wich helps to make it responsive for all devices.
At the bottom of the page I have a footer with the copyright of the owner.

Second page is a model for the other pages. Here users can see the specific information about devices they choose like (Prices, items with discount,most chepest, etc.). Also I used a listbox with the newest products.After listbox on other cells there are information about different product with raitings, pricew and so on.
Most important actions of this website that helps users to manipulate data are:
Items with discount.
Most expensive items.
Most cheapest items.

# Conclusion
After finishing this laboratory work, I got familiarized with bootstrap elements like Grid System and Navigation bar.

# Observation
Bootstrap can be installed in 3 ways:
1) Downloading all css and other libraries from internet manually.
2) Having Internet connection we can just put in our index.html references links and use it.
3) * For mac only: Use bower installer to get all libraries.
